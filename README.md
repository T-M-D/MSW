# MSW
Monitoring System Worker

The goal behind MSW is to provide a ready to use worker appliance for monitoring systems. The term worker refers to offloading the monitoring to another computing node separate to the monitoring server itself, commonly associated with DNX or Mod-Gearman. These utilize Nagios NEB modules that allow you to distribute the execution of monitoring checks.

The worker is indended to be used by Nagios Core and other monitoring systems that use Nagios Core or compatible. If you would like functionality to be added to allow it to work with other monitoring systems then you are welcome to contribute, however the primary focus should be Nagios.

More information will be added here as it becomes available.
